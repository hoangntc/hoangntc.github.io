I am a data scientist with a passion for leveraging data-driven insights to solve complex problems and make informed decisions. My expertise lies in deep learning, machine learning, and statistical analysis to extract meaningful patterns from data. I obtained my Master degree in EECS under the supervision of [Prof. Ebrahim Bagheri](https://www.ecb.torontomu.ca/people/Bagheri.html). I am actively looking for a job. **[Click here to see my CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cdz9Jm-mn9DxpmafxtKK__IVo8UFts5K/view?usp=drive_link)**.
